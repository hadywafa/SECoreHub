# 🐵🍌 Problem: Koko Eating Bananas

> **Goal:** Find the **minimum speed `k`** (bananas per hour) that Koko can eat, such that she finishes all the bananas in all the piles **within `h` hours**.

---

## 📦 Input:

- `piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]`:
  This means there are 4 piles of bananas:

  - Pile 0: 3 bananas
  - Pile 1: 6 bananas
  - Pile 2: 7 bananas
  - Pile 3: 11 bananas

- `h = 8`:
  Koko has 8 hours to eat them all before the guards come back.

---

## 🍽️ How Does Koko Eat?

- She chooses **any pile** each hour.
- She eats up to **`k` bananas per hour**.
- If the pile has **less than `k`**, she eats all of it in that hour.
- She does **not split** a pile across hours. One pile per hour only.

---

## 🧠 So, is it 1 banana per hour?

No — **it’s `k` bananas per hour from a single pile**.

For example, if:

- `k = 3`
- and a pile has 6 bananas,
- then it will take her **2 hours** to finish that pile: 3 + 3.

So:

```txt
pile: 6 bananas, k = 3
hours needed = ceil(6 / 3) = 2
```

---

## 🎯 What’s the Objective?

> Find the **smallest possible `k`** (eating speed per hour) such that:
>
> ⏱️ **Total hours needed across all piles ≤ `h`**

---

## 📊 Example

**Input:**

```csharp
piles = [3, 6, 7, 11], h = 8
```

Let’s try `k = 4`:

- 3 bananas → 1 hour
- 6 bananas → ceil(6 / 4) = 2 hours
- 7 bananas → ceil(7 / 4) = 2 hours
- 11 bananas → ceil(11 / 4) = 3 hours
  **Total = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 hours ✅**

This works, and it's the minimum speed `k`.

---

## 🧮 You Can Solve It Using Binary Search!

- Try all possible `k` values between 1 and max pile size
- Use binary search to speed this up
- For each guess, simulate how many hours it takes

## Example 2

Let's solve this step-by-step for:

```txt
Input: piles = [1, 4, 3, 2], h = 9
```

---

### 🧠 Objective

Find the **minimum eating speed `k`** (bananas/hour) such that Koko can finish **all piles** within **`h = 9` hours**.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Understand total hours needed for a given `k`

For each pile, the time needed = `ceil(pileSize / k)`

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Binary Search Range

- **Minimum `k` = 1** (slowest possible speed)
- **Maximum `k` = max(piles) = 4** (no pile requires more than 1 hour at this speed)

So we search in the range `1..4`

---

### 🔁 Try Binary Search Steps

#### Try `k = 2`

- Pile 1 → ceil(1 / 2) = 1
- Pile 4 → ceil(4 / 2) = 2
- Pile 3 → ceil(3 / 2) = 2
- Pile 2 → ceil(2 / 2) = 1
  Total = **1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 hours ✅**

So we try lower speed → update high = 2

#### Try `k = 1`

- Pile 1 → 1 hour
- Pile 4 → 4 hours
- Pile 3 → 3 hours
- Pile 2 → 2 hours
  Total = **1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 10 hours ❌** (too slow)

So we try higher → update low = 2

---

### ✅ Final Answer: `k = 2`

- This is the **minimum** speed where Koko finishes in ≤ 9 hours.

---

### ✨ Result

```csharp
Output: 2
```

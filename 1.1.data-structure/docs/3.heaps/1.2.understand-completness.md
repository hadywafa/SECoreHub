# 🤔 What is a Complete Binary Tree? (Heap Shape Rule)

> A **complete binary tree** must fill **top-down, left-to-right**, with **NO gaps** in the rows.

✅ Think of it like seating in a theater:
You can’t leave empty seats on the left and sit on the right — everyone must sit **left to right**, filling each row before moving to the next.

---

## 🤔 Your Tree:

```ini
        10
       /  \
     20    30
    /     /  \
  40     60  70
```

Let’s number them **by row and order of insertion** (level-order):

| Level | Position         | Value       |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 1     | Root             | 10          |
| 2     | Left child       | 20          |
| 2     | Right child      | 30          |
| 3     | 20’s left child  | 40          |
| 3     | 20’s right child | ❌ missing! |
| 3     | 30’s left child  | 60          |
| 3     | 30’s right child | 70          |

---

### ❌ The Problem

- At **Level 3**, you have a **missing child on the left** (20's right child is missing)
- But you added **new nodes to the right** (30 has both children)

> ❗ **This breaks the complete binary tree rule**:
>
> > You can't skip a node and fill the next one.

## ✅ What Would Be a Valid Complete Tree?

This is OK ✅:

```ini
        10
       /  \
     20    30
    /  \   /
  40  50  60
```

Here:

- Every row is full except the last
- The last row is **filled left to right with no gaps**

---

## ✅ Now with Max-Heap Property:

Max Heap = Parent must be **bigger than both children**, and structure must be complete.

This is a **valid Max-Heap**:

```ini
        100
       /   \
     90     80
    / \    /
  70  60  50
```

- Structure is complete ✅
- Every parent is bigger than its children ✅

## 🧠 Simple Rules Summary

| Rule                                             | Heap Allows?   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Fill top-down?                                   | ✅ Required    |
| Fill left-to-right?                              | ✅ Required    |
| Gaps in middle rows?                             | ❌ Not allowed |
| Skipping left then filling right?                | ❌ Not allowed |
| Only filling part of bottom row (left to right)? | ✅ Yes         |

---

## 🧮 Want to Check Completeness Yourself?

👉 Number the tree **level-order** (top to bottom, left to right).
If **any earlier index is missing but later ones exist**, it's ❌ not complete.

---

## 🎉 TL;DR

The tree:

```ini
        10
       /  \
     20    30
    /     /  \
  40     60  70
```

❌ Is not complete because:

- 20 is **missing its right child**
- But 30 has children → you **skipped left** and **filled right** → that's illegal in heaps

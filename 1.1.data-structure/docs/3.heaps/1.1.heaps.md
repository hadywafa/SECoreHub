# 🌋 What is a Heap?

A **Heap** is a special **binary tree-based data structure** that satisfies the **Heap Property**:

- In a **Max-Heap**: The value of each node is **greater than or equal to** its children.
- In a **Min-Heap**: The value of each node is **less than or equal to** its children.

Heaps are usually implemented as **binary heaps** using arrays for efficient storage and access.

## 📚 Key Properties of a Heap:

1. **Complete Binary Tree**:

   - Every level is completely filled except possibly the last.
   - The last level is filled **from left to right**.

2. **Heap Property**:

   - Max-Heap → `parent ≥ children`
   - Min-Heap → `parent ≤ children`

## 🎯 Use Cases of Heaps

| Use Case                     | Why Heap?                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Priority Queues              | Always retrieve the highest/lowest  |
| Scheduling systems           | Efficient time-based task execution |
| Dijkstra’s Algorithm         | Fast minimum node retrieval         |
| Heap Sort                    | Sort with O(n log n) performance    |
| Streaming K Largest/Smallest | Efficient top-K selection           |

## 📦 Array Representation:

For a node at index `i`:

- **Left child** = `2i + 1`
- **Right child** = `2i + 2`
- **Parent** = `(i - 1) // 2`

Example (Min-Heap):

```ini
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 6]

        1
       / \
      3   5
     / \   \
    7   9   6
```

## 🔧 Operations:

| Operation                       | Time Complexity | Description                                         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `insert()`                      | O(log n)        | Add element, then "heapify up"                      |
| `extractMin()` / `extractMax()` | O(log n)        | Remove root, replace with last, then "heapify down" |
| `peek()`                        | O(1)            | View root (min or max, depending on type)           |
| `heapify()`                     | O(n)            | Build a heap from an unsorted array                 |

---

## 🛠️ Applications:

- **Priority Queues**
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** (shortest path)
- **Heap Sort**
- **Scheduling Systems**
- **Median Maintenance** (using two heaps)

---

## 🌳 Visual Example: Min-Heap

Array: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8]`

```ini
        1
       / \
      3   5
     / \   \
    7   9   8
```

- `1 < 3`, `1 < 5`, `3 < 7`, `3 < 9`, `5 < 8` ✅

---

## 🧠 Example: Max-Heap Insertion

Let’s insert `15` into `[20, 18, 10, 12]`:

```ini
Before:       20
             /  \
           18    10
          /
        12

Insert 15 at next spot → compare with parent (18)
15 < 18 → No swap → Done

New Heap: [20, 18, 10, 12, 15]
```

## 🛠 Heap as an Array (Complete Binary Tree)

Heaps are usually stored as arrays:

| Index | Value | Relationship     |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------- |
| 0     | 1     | root             |
| 1     | 3     | left child of 0  |
| 2     | 5     | right child of 0 |
| 3     | 7     | left child of 1  |
| 4     | 9     | right child of 1 |
| 5     | 8     | left child of 2  |

### 🔗 Child/Parent Rules

- `Parent(i) = (i - 1) / 2`
- `Left(i) = 2i + 1`
- `Right(i) = 2i + 2`

---

## 📦 Heap Operations

### 🔼 Insertion (Heapify Up)

1. Add value at the **end** of the array.
2. While parent is bigger (max-heap) or smaller (min-heap), **swap up**.
3. Done when heap property is restored.

⏱️ Time: O(log n)

---

### 🔽 Removal (Extract Min or Max)

1. Remove the **root element**.
2. Move the **last element to root**.
3. **Heapify down** to restore property.

⏱️ Time: O(log n)

---

### ♻️ Heapify (Build Heap from Array)

1. Start from the last parent node.
2. Heapify down all the way to root.

⏱️ Time: O(n)

---

## 🧪 Example: Inserting in Min-Heap

Insert `2` into `[3, 4, 5]`:

Array becomes `[3, 4, 5, 2]`
Heapify up: swap `2` and `3`

→ `[2, 4, 5, 3]`

## 📚 Types of Heaps

| Type           | Description                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Min-Heap       | Smallest element at the root      |
| Max-Heap       | Largest element at the root       |
| Binary Heap    | Heap implemented as binary tree   |
| Fibonacci Heap | Faster amortized insert, merge    |
| Binomial Heap  | Supports quick merge of heaps     |
| Pairing Heap   | Simpler, faster for practical use |

## 🧠 Heap vs BST vs AVL vs PriorityQueue

| Feature        | Heap          | BST          | AVL Tree             | PriorityQueue      |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Shape          | Complete Tree | BST rules    | Balanced BST         | Min-Heap (in .NET) |
| Search Time    | ❌ O(n)       | ✅ O(log n)  | ✅ O(log n)          | ❌ O(n)            |
| Insert/Delete  | ✅ O(log n)   | ✅ O(log n)  | ✅ O(log n)          | ✅ O(log n)        |
| Ordered Output | ❌ No         | ✅ In-Order  | ✅ In-Order          | ❌ No              |
| Use Case       | Top-K items   | Full sorting | Fast ordered storage | Tasks by priority  |

## 🧠 When Should You Use a Heap?

- You need to **repeatedly get the smallest/largest item**
- You're solving problems like:

  - Top K elements
  - Median in a stream
  - Dijkstra’s shortest path
  - CPU or disk scheduling

# Array Data Structure

## Definition

An array is simple data structure that consist of a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. It is a linear data structure where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.

## Characteristics

- **Fixed Size:** Arrays have a fixed size once initialized, and this size cannot be changed dynamically.
- **Indexing:** Elements in an array are accessed using an index (or subscript), starting from 0.
- **Homogeneous:** Arrays store elements of the same data type.

## Operations

### Initialization

```csharp
int[] array1 = new int[3];// [0,0,0]
int[] array2 = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }; // [1,2,3]
int[] array3 = [10, 12, 24]; // [10, 12, 24]
```

### Accessing Elements

```csharp
int firstElement = numbers[0];
```

### Updating Elements

```csharp
numbers[2] = 10;
```

### Insert Elements

1. Using the `Array.Resize` Method:

```csharp
int[] array = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
Array.Resize(ref array, array.Length + 1);
array[array.Length - 1] = 6;
```

1. Using the `Array.Copy` Method:

```csharp
int[] array = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
int[] newArray = new int[array.Length + 1];
Array.Copy(array, newArray, array.Length);
newArray[array.Length] = 6;
array = newArray;
```

1. Using the LINQ `Concat` Method:

```csharp
int[] array = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
array = array.Concat(new int[] { 6 }).ToArray();
```

1. Using the `List<T>` Class:

```csharp
List<int> list = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
list.Add(6);
int[] array = list.ToArray();
```

1. Using `Insert` Method in `List<T>`:

```csharp
List<int> list = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
list.Insert(2, 6); // Insert 6 at index 2
int[] array = list.ToArray();
```

1. using custom Extension insert method

```cs
public static class ArrayExtensions
{
    public static T[] Insert<T>(this T[] array, int index, T item)
    {
        if (index < 0 || index > array.Length)
        {
            throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(index), "Index is out of range.");
        }

        T[] newArray = new T[array.Length + 1];
        Array.Copy(array, 0, newArray, 0, index);
        newArray[index] = item;
        Array.Copy(array, index, newArray, index + 1, array.Length - index);

        return newArray;
    }
}
```

```cs
    static void Main()
    {
        int[] array = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        array = array.Insert(2, 6);

        foreach (var item in array)
        {
            Console.Write(item + " ");
        }
    }
```

### Iterating Through Array

```csharp
foreach (int num in numbers)
{
    // Do something with num
}
```

## Time Complexity

- `Access`: O(1) - Constant time complexity for accessing an element by index.
- `Search`: O(n) - Linear time complexity for searching an element (in worst case, when searching without any additional information).
- `Insertion/Deletion`: O(n) - Linear time complexity for inserting or deleting an element, as it may require shifting elements.

## Use Cases

- When the size of the collection is known and does not change frequently.
- Efficient for random access of elements using an index.
- Implementation of various algorithms and data structures.

## Limitations

- Fixed size: Cannot easily accommodate a dynamically changing number of elements.
- Inefficient for frequent insertions or deletions as they require shifting elements.

## Static vs Dynamic Arrays

The fundamental data structure of arrays remains the same whether you refer to them as "static" or "dynamic."

### Static Array

- **Definition:** A static array has a fixed size, and its length is determined at the time of initialization.
- **Characteristics:**
  - The size is fixed and cannot be changed dynamically.
  - Limited operations for resizing or modifying the array.

### Dynamic Array

- **Definition:** A dynamic array is associated with resizable arrays or dynamic arrays in programming languages.
- **Characteristics:**
  - The size can be changed dynamically, allowing for growth or shrinkage.
  - Provides methods (e.g., `Add`, `Remove`, `Insert`) for easy manipulation of elements.
  - Internally manages resizing and copying of the array when necessary.

In both cases, the underlying data structure is an array, a contiguous block of memory that stores elements. The difference lies in how these arrays are handled regarding size changes and the availability of methods for convenient operations.

In languages like C#, static arrays are created using fixed-size declarations  
 `int[] staticArray = new int[3];`
, while dynamic arrays are often implemented using collections like `List<T>`, which provides dynamic resizing capabilities and additional methods for array manipulation.

In JavaScript, the term "static array" is less commonly used, as arrays in JavaScript are inherently dynamic and can be resized dynamically using built-in methods like `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, and more.

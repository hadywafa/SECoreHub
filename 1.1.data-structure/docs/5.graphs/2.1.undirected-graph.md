# 🌐 What is an Undirected Graph?

An **undirected graph** is a graph where **edges do not have direction** — meaning, if there's a connection between `A` and `B`, you can **go from A to B and B to A** freely.

> 💡 If one node is connected to another, the connection works both ways.

## 📘 Real-Life Examples

| Scenario               | Nodes (Vertices) | Edges (Connections)            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Social network friends | People           | Friendship (mutual)            |
| Roads between cities   | Cities           | Two-way roads                  |
| Local file sharing     | Computers        | Network cables (two-way links) |
| Collaboration graph    | GitHub users     | Co-authorship on a repo        |

## 🧱 Visual Example

Here's an **undirected graph** with 4 nodes: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`

```ini
     A
    / \
   B   C
    \ /
     D
```

- Edges:

  - A—B
  - A—C
  - B—D
  - C—D

> Notice: **A—B** is the same as **B—A**

## 🧠 Characteristics of Undirected Graphs

| Property               | Value                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Edges**              | No direction (bi-directional)            |
| **A—B = B—A**          | ✅ Both paths are valid                  |
| **Adjacency List**     | Store each connection in both directions |
| **Cycles possible?**   | ✅ Yes                                   |
| **Connected Graph**    | All nodes can reach each other           |
| **Disconnected Graph** | Some nodes can’t be reached              |

## 🧮 Example: Adjacency List of Undirected Graph

Graph:

```ini
Edges: A-B, A-C, B-D, C-D
```

Adjacency list:

```csharp
{
  A: [B, C],
  B: [A, D],
  C: [A, D],
  D: [B, C]
}
```

- A is connected to B and C
- B is connected to A and D
- D is connected to B and C
- Every connection is stored **twice** for bi-directionality

## ✅ Real Use in Algorithms

| Task                             | Undirected Graph Use?           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Finding Connected Components** | ✅ Yes                          |
| **Detecting Cycles**             | ✅ Use DFS with parent tracking |
| **Graph Coloring**               | ✅                              |
| **Kruskal/Prim’s MST**           | ✅                              |
| **Path Finding (BFS/DFS)**       | ✅                              |

## 🚫 Common Mistake

> If you only store the edge one way, you're creating a **directed graph** by accident!

In an **undirected graph**, always do:

```csharp
adjList[A].Add(B);
adjList[B].Add(A); // ← don't forget the reverse!
```

## 📌 Summary

| Feature           | Undirected Graph                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Edges             | No direction (2-way)                             |
| Representation    | Store edges both directions                      |
| Storage structure | Adjacency list (best), matrix (for dense graphs) |
| Examples          | Maps, friends, devices                           |

# ✅ **Best Tools to Visualize Code / LeetCode Problems**

Here are the **top tools**, ranked by purpose and what they're best at:

---

## 🧠 1. **Python Tutor** (Yes, it works for C# too!)

📍 **URL:** [https://pythontutor.com/](https://pythontutor.com/)

✅ Best For:

- Step-by-step code visualization
- Stack, heap, and variable tracking
- Supporting multiple languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C, TypeScript)

⚠️ Limitations:

- No native C#, but you can simulate it using Java logic easily
- Not ideal for GUI-style flowcharts, but great for algorithmic tracing

---

## 📊 2. **Visualgo.net**

📍 **URL:** [https://visualgo.net/en](https://visualgo.net/en)

✅ Best For:

- Visualizing stacks, queues, arrays, graphs, sorting
- Animating algorithm steps
- Very intuitive for stack-based problems

⚠️ Limitations:

- Doesn’t let you write arbitrary code
- You simulate logic via operations

Use it to demonstrate:

> Push/Pop sequence for the monotonic stack in `DailyTemperatures`

## 🧩 3. **Tracey (trace.dog)**

📍 **URL:** [https://trace.dog/](https://trace.dog/)

✅ Best For:

- Visualizing **JavaScript and TypeScript** code execution
- Clean timeline-based tracing

⚠️ Limitation: Not for C#/Java directly — but you can translate

---

## 🔧 4. **Excalidraw or Draw\.io** (Manual diagrams)

📍 [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) / [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)

✅ Best For:

- Custom flowcharts or stack evolution
- You can manually draw stack + array state for each step

⚠️ Manual effort needed

---

## 💡 Bonus: **OBSIDIAN + Excalidraw Plugin** (for Markdown Notebooks)

If you're building your own study notes — this combo is incredible.

## 🔁 Alternative Idea: Use a **Step Table**

For `temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]`, build a table like:

| i   | Temp | Stack (Before) | Stack (After) | Answer\[] Update     |
| --- | ---- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| 0   | 73   | \[]            | \[0]          |                      |
| 1   | 74   | \[0]           | \[1]          | answer\[0] = 1       |
| 2   | 75   | \[1]           | \[2]          | answer\[1] = 1       |
| 3   | 71   | \[2]           | \[2,3]        |                      |
| 4   | 69   | \[2,3]         | \[2,3,4]      |                      |
| 5   | 72   | \[2,3,4]       | \[2,5]        | answer\[4]=1, \[3]=2 |
| 6   | 76   | \[2,5]         | \[6]          | answer\[5]=1, \[2]=4 |
| 7   | 73   | \[6]           | \[6,7]        |                      |

Perfect for learning, teaching, or interviews.

## ✅ Best Recommendation (for you)

Since you're working with C# and want to **visualize data structures evolving**, I recommend:

1. **Python Tutor** — to trace logic
2. **Visualgo** — to show how the monotonic stack changes
3. **Draw\.io table or Excalidraw** — for custom diagrams (especially stack + answers array)

If you want, I can draw one of these (e.g., the stack + answer update table) as a diagram for you — just say the word 👇
